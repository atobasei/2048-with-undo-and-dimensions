## 2048-with-undo-and-dimensions

I have a bit of an obsession with playing the tile game 2048. Its fun and creative and gives me something to do in the background while I think. I also especially enjoy playing on different dimensions than the 4x4 as it adds a layer of nuance where certain new patters can become viable while others no longer work. Unfortunately much of the online 2048 sites do not support a true undo feature for these more obscure dimensions, so I decided to just make one myself!
